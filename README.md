# Tuning BlueTooth-Controlled CAR

This is our final project for Creative Electronics, a BEng Electronic Engineering 4th year module at the University of Malaga, School of Telecommunication.

We took an old radio control car and turned it into a tuning car controlled by arduino uno with a bluetooth module.
